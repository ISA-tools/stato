What is the purpose of the STATO module for OBI?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. provide classes for annotating statistical methods used in biological investigation, but also metrics and estimates generated by those methods and link to the hypothesis being evuated to allow better representation

2. provide formal definition of most statistical tests to provide a didactic framework for students and reviewers

3. provide a formal way of validating resutls and suitable of applicability of tests when using the data

4. provide a semantic framework to suppport the creation of standardized data matrices for differential abundance analysis, association studies and screening results.

5. provide a  vocabulary for test mining


TODO: 
the notion of effect
the notion of error
the notion of false positive and false negative (eventhough we define the notions of 'false positive rate' and 'false negative rate')
