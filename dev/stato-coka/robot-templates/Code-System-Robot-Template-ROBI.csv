Alper, Philippe Rocca-Serra, Joanne Dehnbostel, Mario Tristan, Harold Lehmann",EWG Agreement:,EWG Disagreement:,,,"From Catalogue of Bias: A systematic distortion, due to a design problem, an interfering factor, or a judgement, that can affect the conception, design, or conduct of a study, or the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, or discussion of outcome data, causing erroneous overestimation or underestimation of the probable size of an effect or association (https://catalogofbias.org/2018/06/15/a-word-about-evidence-6-bias-a-proposed-definition/)","Causal inferences from randomised trials can, however, be undermined by flaws in design, conduct, analyses, and reporting, leading to underestimation or overestimation of the true intervention effect (bias).2    Flaws in the design, conduct, analysis, and reporting of randomised trials can cause the effect of an intervention to be underestimated or overestimated. The notion of study “quality” is not well defined but relates to the extent to which its design, conduct, analysis, and presentation were appropriate to answer its research question.",,,,"Bias occurs if systematic flaws or limitations in the design, conduct or analysis of a review distort the results. ",,,"Bias is usually defined as the presence of systematic error in a study that leads to distorted or flawed results and hampers the study's internal validity. In prediction model development and validation, known features exist that make a study at ROB, although empirical evidence showing the most important sources of bias is limited. We define ROB to occur when shortcomings in the study design, conduct, or analysis lead to systematically distorted estimates of model predictive performance.",,,"Bias is a systematic error or deviation from the truth, either in the results or in their inferences.",,"New Oxford Dictionary-bias-a systematic distortion of a statistical result due to a factor not allowed for in its derivation
Merriam-Webster Dictionary includes: (1): deviation of the expected value of a statistical estimate from the quantity it estimates
(2): systematic error introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others
