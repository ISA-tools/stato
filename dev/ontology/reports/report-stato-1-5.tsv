A symmetric inverted funnel shape arises from a ‘well-behaved’ data set, in which publication bias is unlikely. An asymmetric funnel indicates a relationship between treatment effect and study size. 
Known caveats: If high precision studies really are different from low precision studies with respect to effect size (e.g., due to different populations examined) a funnel plot may give a wrong impression of publication bias. The appearance of the funnel plot can change quite dramatically depending on the scale on the y-axis — whether it is the inverse square error or the trial size.

SSMD directly measures the magnitude of difference between two groups.
SSMD is widely used in High Content Screen for hit selection and quality control.

When the data is preprocessed using log-transformation as normally done in HTS experiments, SSMD is the mean of log fold change divided by the standard deviation of log fold change with respect to a negative reference. 

In other words, SSMD is the average fold change (on the log scale) penalized by the variability of fold change (on the log scale).

For quality control, one index for the quality of an HTS assay is the magnitude of difference between a positive control and a negative reference in an assay plate. For hit selection, the size of effects of a compound (i.e., a small molecule or an siRNA) is represented by the magnitude of difference between the compound and a negative reference. SSMD directly measures the magnitude of difference between two groups. Therefore, SSMD can be used for both quality control and hit selection in HTS experiments.@en"

In biomedicine, the Weibull probability is used to in determining 'hazard functions'. 

The 'location parameter' of the Weibull probability distribution can be used to define a failure-free zone.

If the quantity X is a \""time-to-failure\"", the Weibull distribution gives a distribution for which the failure rate is proportional to a power of time. The shape parameter, k, is that power plus one, and so this parameter can be interpreted directly as follows:
A value of {\displaystyle k<1\,} {\displaystyle k<1\,} indicates that the failure rate decreases over time. This happens if there is significant \""infant mortality\"", or defective items failing early and the failure rate decreasing over time as the defective items are weeded out of the population. In the context of the diffusion of innovations, this means negative word of mouth: the hazard function is a monotonically decreasing function of the proportion of adopters;
A value of {\displaystyle k=1\,} {\displaystyle k=1\,} indicates that the failure rate is constant over time. This might suggest random external events are causing mortality, or failure. The Weibull distribution reduces to an exponential distribution;
A value of {\displaystyle k>1\,} {\displaystyle k>1\,} indicates that the failure rate increases with time. This happens if there is an \""aging\"" process, or parts that are more likely to fail as time goes on. In the context of the diffusion of innovations, this means positive word of mouth: the hazard function is a monotonically increasing function of the proportion of adopters.
