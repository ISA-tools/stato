Mostly they are necessary, occasionally they are necessary and sufficient or just sufficient. Often they use terms that are not themselves defined and so they effectively can't be evaluated by those criteria.         On the specifics of the proposed definition:        We don't have definitions of 'meaning' or 'expression' or 'property'. For 'reference' in the intended sense I think we use the term 'denotation'. For 'expression', I think we you mean symbol, or identifier. For 'meaning' it differs for class and property. For class we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine whether an entity is instance of the class, or not. For property we want documentation that let's the intended reader determine, given a pair of potential relata, whether the assertion that the relation holds is true. The 'intended reader' part suggests that we also specify who, we expect, would be able to understand the definition, and also generalizes over human and computer reader to include textual and logical definition.         Personally, I am more comfortable weakening definition to documentation, with instructions as to what is desirable.         We also have the outstanding issue of how to aim different definitions to different audiences. A clinical audience reading chebi wants a different sort of definition documentation/definition from a chemistry trained audience, and similarly there is a need for a definition that is adequate for an ontologist to work with.  @en

WARN	annotation_whitespace	OBI:0000968	IAO:0000116	2012-12-17 JAO: In common lab usage, there is a distinction made between devices and reagents that is difficult to model. Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of \"device\", and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.        2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:        (1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.        (2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.        (3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.        In the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay.

An asymmetric funnel indicates a relationship between treatment effect and study size.     Known caveats: If high precision studies really are different from low precision studies with respect to effect size (e.g., due to different populations examined) a funnel plot may give a wrong impression of publication bias.

INFO	lowercase_definition	STATO:0000135	IAO:0000115	strictly standardized mean difference (SSMS) is a standardized mean difference which corresponds to the  ratio of mean to the standard deviation of the difference between two groups.     SSMD directly measures the magnitude of difference between two groups.    SSMD is widely used in High Content Screen for hit selection and quality control.        When the data is preprocessed using log-transformation as normally done in HTS experiments, SSMD is the mean of log fold change divided by the standard deviation of log fold change with respect to a negative reference.         In other words, SSMD is the average fold change (on the log scale) penalized by the variability of fold change (on the log scale).        For quality control, one index for the quality of an HTS assay is the magnitude of difference between a positive control and a negative reference in an assay plate. For hit selection, the size of effects of a compound (i.e., a small molecule or an siRNA) is represented by the magnitude of difference between the compound and a negative reference. SSMD directly measures the magnitude of difference between two groups. Therefore, SSMD can be used for both quality control and hit selection in HTS experiments.@en

INFO	lowercase_definition	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/stato.owl#http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/STATO_0000501	IAO:0000115	the Weibull probability distribution is continuous probabibility distribution which is used to model time to fail, time to repair and material strength in material science. In biomedicine, the Weibull probability is used to in determining 'hazard functions'.         The 'location parameter' of the Weibull probability distribution can be used to define a failure-free zone.        If the quantity X is a \"time-to-failure\", the Weibull distribution gives a distribution for which the failure rate is proportional to a power of time. The shape parameter, k, is that power plus one, and so this parameter can be interpreted directly as follows:    A value of {\displaystyle k<1\,} {\displaystyle k<1\,} indicates that the failure rate decreases over time. This happens if there is significant \"infant mortality\", or defective items failing early and the failure rate decreasing over time as the defective items are weeded out of the population. In the context of the diffusion of innovations, this means negative word of mouth: the hazard function is a monotonically decreasing function of the proportion of adopters;    A value of {\displaystyle k=1\,} {\displaystyle k=1\,} indicates that the failure rate is constant over time. This might suggest random external events are causing mortality, or failure. The Weibull distribution reduces to an exponential distribution;    A value of {\displaystyle k>1\,} {\displaystyle k>1\,} indicates that the failure rate increases with time. This happens if there is an \"aging\" process, or parts that are more likely to fail as time goes on. In the context of the diffusion of innovations, this means positive word of mouth: the hazard function is a monotonically increasing function of the proportion of adopters. The function is first concave, then convex with an inflexion point at {\displaystyle (e^{1/k}-1)/e^{1/k},k>1\,} {\displaystyle (e^{1/k}-1)/e^{1/k},k>1\,}.@en	
INFO	lowercase_definition	http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/stato.owl#restricted_randomized_design	IAO:0000115	a restricted randomized design is a kind of study design which uses randomization to allocate observation unit to treatment but where intuitively poor allocations of treatments to experimental units are avoided, while retaining the theoretical benefits of randomization. This is often the case when so-called 'hard to change' factors are used in an experimental design.@en

INFO	lowercase_definition	http://www.co-ode.org/ontologies/ont.owl#group_sequential_design	IAO:0000115	group sequential design is a study design used in clinical trial settings in which interim analyses of the data are conducted after groups of patients are recruited. After each interim analysis, the trial may stop early if the evidence so far shows the new treatment is particularly effective or ineffective. Such designs are ethical and cost-effective, and so are of great interest in practice. @en
