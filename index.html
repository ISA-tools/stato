<p>STATO is a <strong>general-purpose STATistics Ontology</strong>. Its aim is to provide coverage for processes such as statistical tests, their conditions of applications, and information needed or resulting from statistical methods, such as probability distributions, variable, spread and variation metrics. STATO also covers aspects of experimental design and description of plots and graphical representations commonly used to provide visual cues of data distribution or layout and to assist review of the results.</p>

<p>Started in early 2012, as part of the requirement of the <strong>community-driven ISA Commons</strong> [1, 2] to represent data matrices and their statistical values, STATO is a standalone projects since Nov 2012. STATO is driven and funded by several ISA-based projects and their user community, but also by collaborations with <strong>data publication platforms</strong> [e.g. 3, 4]. STATO is applicable to, but not limited, the broad life, natural and biomedical science domain with <strong>documented applications</strong> for factorial design, association studies, differential expression, hit selection and meta-analysis.</p>

<p>STATO also benefits from: (i) <strong>extensive documentation</strong> with the provision of textual and formal definitions; (ii) an <strong>associated R code snippets</strong> using the dedicated R-command metadata tag, aiming at facilitating teaching and learning while relying of the popular R language; (iii) <strong>query examples</strong> documentation, highlighting how the ontology can be harnessed for reviewers/tutors/student alike.

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objectives</h3>

<p>The demand-driven nature of STATO ensures its objectives fit the requirements of the communities it has build with and for. STATO is set to provide:</p>

<ol>

<li>a common terminology, with formal definitions, to smooth the communication between, mainly, biologists and statisticians but also scientists in other domains relying on statistical methods and commonly used graphical representation, as well specialized, application specific ones.. Also, journal reviewers will find it useful, as the basis for standardised reporting of data matrices.</li>

<li>a set of core classes for annotating statistical methods used in life, natural and biomedical sciences investigations, but also metrics and estimates generated by those methods and link to the hypothesis being evaluated to allow better representation and data review.</li>

<li>formal definition of most statistical tests to provide a didactic framework for students and reviewers</li>

<li>a formal way of validating results and the suitability of the application of statistical tests when using the data</li>

<li>a semantic framework to support the creation of standardized data matrices to help with reproducibility and review of results.</li>

<li>a vocabulary for text mining of statistical analysis for, for example, scholarly articles.</li>

</ol>

 <a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RC1 content overview</h3>

<p>STATO has been developed to interoperate with other OBO Foundry ontologies (e.g. OBI), hence relies on BFO as a top level ontology and uses OBI as mid-level ontology.</p>

<p>Release Candidate Version 1 has <strong>281 terms</strong>, including 269 classes, 9 object properties, 1 data property and 2 annotation properties. STATO provides textual definitions for all terms, as well as <strong>formal definitions</strong> for 200 terms allowing automatic classification of the statistical methods depending on the nature of the variables used as input, the conditions and their domain of application.</p>
