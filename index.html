<p>STATO is a <b>general-purpose STATistics Ontology</b>. Its aim is to provide coverage for processes such as statistical tests, their conditions of applications, and information needed or resulting from statistical methods, such as probability distributions, variable, spread and variation metrics. STATO also covers aspects of experimental design and description of plots and graphical representations commonly used to provide visual cues of data distribution or layout and to assist review of the results.</p>

<p>Started in early 2012, as part of the requirement of the community-driven ISA Commons [1, 2] to represent data matrices and their statistical values, STATO is a standalone projects since Nov 2012. STATO is driven and funded by several ISA-based projects and their user community, but also by collaborations with data publication platforms [e.g. 3, 4]. STATO is applicable to, but not limited, the broad life, natural and biomedical science domain with <b>documented applications</b> for factorial design, association studies, differential expression, hit selection and meta-analysis.</p>

<p>STATO also benefits from: (i) <b>extensive documentation</b> with the provision of textual and formal definitions; (ii) an <b>associated R code snippets</b> using the dedicated R-command metadata tag, aiming at facilitating teaching and learning while relying of the popular R language; (iii) <b>query examples</b> documentation, highlighting how the ontology can be harnessed for reviewers/tutors/student alike.

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
